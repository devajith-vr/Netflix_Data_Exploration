Netflix Content Trends Analysis
---

• Project Summary

This project explores Netflix’s content dataset to understand how the platform’s library has evolved over time. The analysis focuses on identifying trends in content type, genre distribution, and country-wise production, with the aim of drawing practical insights from real data.

Rather than treating this as a purely technical exercise, the project approaches the dataset from an analytical perspective—cleaning the data, visualizing patterns, and interpreting what those patterns say about Netflix’s content strategy.

• Motivation

Netflix continuously expands its catalog to meet changing viewer preferences. This project was undertaken to examine:

Whether Netflix is moving more toward Movies or TV Shows

Which genres dominate the platform and how they change over time

How content production varies across countries

The goal was to translate raw data into insights that reflect real-world business decisions.

• Dataset Overview

Total titles analyzed: 7,789

Content types: Movies and TV Shows

Release period: 2008 to 2021

Dataset structure: 11 features, including title, category, country, release date, rating, duration, genre, and description

• Data Preparation and Feature Engineering

To ensure reliable analysis, the dataset was carefully prepared:

Release dates were standardized and the release year was extracted

Missing values in key columns such as director, cast, country, and rating were addressed

Genre information was simplified by extracting a primary genre for consistent analysis

These steps ensured the dataset was clean, structured, and suitable for trend analysis.

• Analysis Approach

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed using visual techniques to identify patterns and trends:

Year-wise comparison of Movies and TV Shows to observe content growth

Genre frequency analysis to identify dominant genres

Country-wise comparison of content types to understand regional contributions

Global visualization of content distribution using a choropleth map

Trend analysis of popular genres across different years

The focus throughout the analysis was clarity and interpretability.

• Key Insights

Movies currently make up the majority of Netflix’s library, while TV Shows have shown consistent growth

The United States and India are the largest contributors to Netflix’s content catalog

Certain genres maintain steady popularity across years, indicating long-term audience demand

Netflix’s content expansion has become increasingly international over time

• Skills Demonstrated

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis and visualization

Trend identification and interpretation

Use of Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly

• Conclusion

This project demonstrates how exploratory data analysis can be applied to real-world datasets to extract meaningful insights. By examining Netflix’s content trends across multiple dimensions, the analysis provides a clear understanding of how data can support strategic decision-making in the streaming industry.
