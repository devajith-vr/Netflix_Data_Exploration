• Project Description


This project focuses on analyzing Netflix’s content dataset to understand how the platform’s content has evolved over time. The goal of the analysis is to identify trends in content type, genre popularity, and country-wise distribution, and to observe how Netflix has expanded its library over the years.

The project emphasizes practical data analysis using Python, with a strong focus on cleaning real-world data, visualizing trends, and drawing meaningful insights from the results.

• Objectives

To identify the most common and popular genres

To study country-wise contribution to Netflix content

To compare Movies and TV Shows across different regions

To gain hands-on experience with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

• Data Preparation

Before performing the analysis, the dataset was cleaned and prepared to ensure accuracy:

Converted release dates into datetime format

Extracted the release year for trend analysis

Handled missing values by replacing them with appropriate placeholders

Created a Main Genre column to simplify genre-based analysis

These steps helped make the dataset consistent and suitable for analysis.

• Exploratory Data Analysis

The following analyses and visualizations were performed:

Year-wise comparison of Movies vs TV Shows

Identification of Top 10 genres based on frequency

Country-wise comparison of Movies and TV Shows using stacked bar charts

Global content distribution using a choropleth map

Trend analysis of popular genres over time

Each visualization was designed to clearly communicate trends and patterns.

• Key Insights

Movies make up the majority of Netflix’s content, but TV Shows have shown steady growth in recent years

The United States and India are the largest contributors to Netflix’s content library

Certain genres remain consistently popular across multiple years

Netflix’s international content expansion became more significant after 2015

• Skills and Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained practical experience in:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis

Data visualization and interpretation

Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly

• Conclusion

This analysis provides a clear view of how Netflix’s content strategy has evolved over time. By studying trends in content type, genres, and countries, the project demonstrates how data analysis can support understanding of business decisions in the streaming industry.
